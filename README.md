# wsnmachinelearningmodel
Python code covers the algorithm used to create data for a machine learning model to recommend data aggregation techniques.

This is code that covers research in the Internet of Things, Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine Learning.
The aim of the research included the management of devices in IoT environments.

It required the generation of data using the NS3 simuulation software, followed by the analysis of the same software using Python.
Python was used to pre-process the data and to build mahcine learning models that could recommend device behaviour given a specific IoT scenario.
